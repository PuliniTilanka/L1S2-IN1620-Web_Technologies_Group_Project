                Founded by Janaka Alahapperuma in 2016, today, Sanora Higher Educational Institute has become the foremost learning center 
                for the highest number of a dvanced level students in the Southern Province in Sri Lanka. 
                Every year its students top the ranking in island’s A/L Examination but not limiting to that, 
                the Institute also ensures its students are well disciplined, nature loving, creative humans who are ready to step out 
                into the society. Thus the theme, “Education along with Humanity” at Sanora Higher Educational Institute.
